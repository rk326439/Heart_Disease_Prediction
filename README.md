# Predicting Heart Disease with Machine Learning

**Heart Disease Prediction** It is a project focused on using Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. According to the World Health Organization, heart disease is a significant global health concern, responsible for 12 million deaths annually. It's a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early diagnosis of heart disease is crucial for making informed decisions about lifestyle changes and reducing complications.

Machine Learning offers a powerful tool for analyzing healthcare data and making predictions based on various risk factors. This project, however, uses a logistic regression algorithm to classify patients into those with heart disease and those without it. While heart disease can manifest in different ways, there is a common set of core risk factors that influence an individual's likelihood of developing heart disease. 

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to utilize data from various sources, classify it under suitable headings, and analyze it to predict the occurrence of heart disease. Logistic regression, a fundamental Machine Learning technique, is used for this prediction task.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains patient information and various health-related attributes. These attributes are crucial in determining the risk of heart disease. The data has been carefully collected and cleaned to ensure reliable results.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered a dataset with patient information and health attributes.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data for model training.

3. **Model Selection**: Utilized logistic regression as the chosen Machine Learning algorithm for predicting heart disease.

4. **Model Training**: Trained the logistic regression model on the prepared dataset.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance and assessed its accuracy in predicting heart disease.

## Conclusion

While this project specifically employs logistic regression for heart disease prediction, it highlights the potential of Machine Learning in assisting healthcare professionals. The accuracy of predictions can be improved by incorporating more advanced models and additional data sources.

Heart disease remains a global challenge, and the early detection of heart disease is essential for better healthcare decision-making. The field of data analysis, in conjunction with Machine Learning, offers a promising path towards achieving this goal.
